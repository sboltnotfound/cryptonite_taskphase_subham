# Reading Manuals
pretty simple, just had to use the manual of challenge and read the description to know what argument to pass.

# Searching Manuals
again pretty self explanatory, had to search for the 'flag' in the manual and use 'n' to go to next result.

pretty cool question, had to read the manual of manual, and saw the '-K' argument which searches for a text in all manual pages, so i just did 'man -K challenge' and the first result was the original challenge command.
