# Untangling users

# Becoming root with su
pretty simple problem, use 'su' and the password thats given to get root acess and then use cat to get the flag.

# Other users with su
pretty simple just had to follow the steps, to get su zardus and get zardus's acess and then run the 'run' program to get flag.

# cracking passwords
pretty simple, used the shadow leak to get zardus's password and using that get root access and then run the program. (intialy i tried using the 'password1337' lol)

# using sudo
just use sudo cat /flag, to read the flag.
