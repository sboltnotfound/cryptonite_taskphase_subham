# level- 1.0
pretty simple, i gave the input and it was already giving "expected output" in hexadecimal, so i just had to convert tat back to text and give tat as input and viola we got flag.

# level 1.1
when i saw all the strings in the program , i found one of the strings out of place "bypyb" and then i put this in the license key and viola we got flag

# level 2.0
notices that the first and the 2nd position characters wre geting swapped, hence just swap those 2 in the expected result and got flag.
