# Inspect HTML
just had to inspect it and see the flag as a comment.

# Introtoburp
this was pretty interesting, had to use the hints to understand 'burp suite' is a thing, and the 2nd hint said that maybe the server side doesn't handle "malformed requests" very well, so i just thought what if otp= nothing, that didn't quite work, then i tried like while sending the request through the repeater thingy i just removed otp completely, that didn't quite work, then i just instead of otp i changed its name, and that worked out!
Ill be honest question was not a "intro" coz it gave nothing on the problem statement, had to use other sources to know how to use burp suite- "https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/reissuing-http-requests"

# Dont-use-client-side
Pretty simple, just had to use inspect and then i could access the java script, and then i noticed it literally just used a if else statement to check the "password", and it literally had the flags just splited differently. just had to combine them to get the flag.

# where are the robots
pretty simple. so essentially robots.txt file tells the search enginee which urls can be accessed, so i just opened tht up and saw that it was disallowing some directory, just went there and found flag.

# SQL Direct
ok, so for this problem i had used the "help" command and then the "/?" command then i found a "/dt" command to list all tables, so i used that to find a table called "flags", then i had some previous knowledge about sql and used "SELECT * FROM flags;" to get all the contents of the table and i found one address with picoCTF.

#  Power Cookie
Pretty simple, just had to change the cookie's value to 1.

#   Who are you
I had to study about some headers which can do tasks according to what was asked, like user-agent changed the browser, referer refered to the last visted site, date is date, DNT is a boolean value which indiciates do not track, X-forwarded-for to indetify the ip adresss, Accept-language to accept speicifc languages. User burp suite's repeater to send these headers
